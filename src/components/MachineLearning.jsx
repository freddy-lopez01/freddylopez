              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p className="desc">This project implements a machine learning model to predict diseases based on 
                symptoms using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing 
                symptom severity weights and their associated diseases. The primary objective is to predict 
                the correct disease based on input symptoms and analyze the performance of the model with different hyperparameters.
                The final overall accuracy of the model was 99% with an average F-1 score of the model being 99% as well. Due to the 
                small nature of the dataset and the decision tree performed exceptionally well.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p className="desc">This model was trained utilizing a decision tree model and did NOT utilize libraries such as ScikitLearn, 
                Pytorch, or Tensorflow. The funcitons for determiing the best feature to split on, entropy, info gain, etc, were implemented by hand. 
                Both Perceptron and Logistic Regression algotrithms were implemented to compare which performed better. 
                I began by loading the data from a file and then compute the sigmoid activation for inputs. I trainedc the logistic 
                regression model using batch gradient descent, where I initialize weights and bias, update them iteratively based on 
                gradients, and apply L2 regularization. After training, I use the model to predict the probability of the positive class 
                for new input features. Finally, I manage the entire workflow, from data loading and model training to evaluating its 
                accuracy on a test set and reporting the results.</p>
              <p className="desc">The final accuracy for this model resulted in a 98% accuracy.</p>
